# Friend Recommendation Algorithm
Recommend mutual friends to connect to in a social network.

## Use Case
Within a social network, help people get to know more people.

## Requirement
Given a database of :
* People
* Connections between people

When the API is called to find out the friend recommendations for a person,
the algorithm should recommend a list of people based on most mutual connections.

## Future enhancements
If there are not enough mutual friends, show the most popular people.
